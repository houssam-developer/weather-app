My portfolio can be found here: "https://my-portfolio-he.netlify.app/".
Thanks to that challenge, I learn to work efficiently in order to succeed.
And I hope to make more beautifuls websites and become an expert in front-end developmemt :)

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/mM1UIenRhK808W8qmLWv) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

Challenge: Create a weather app using an API. Use Front-end libraries like React or Vue. Donâ€™t look at the existing solution. Fulfill user stories below:

- User story: I can see city weather as default, preferably my current location
- User story: I can search for city
- User story: I can see weather of today and the next 5 days
- User story: I can see the date and location of the weather
- User story: I can see according to image for each type of weather
- User story: I can see the min and max degree each day
- User story: I can see wind status and wind direction
- User story: I can see humidity percentage
- User story: I can see a visibility indicator
- User story: I can see the air pressure number
- User story(optional): I can request my current location weather
- User story(optional): I can convert temperature in Celcius to Fahrenheit and vice versa

API: https://www.metaweather.com/api/

Tips: For Front-end developer, you can use https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/ to help with accessing data from other websites that are normally forbidden by the same-origin policy of web browsers
